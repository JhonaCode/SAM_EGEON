!!!!skip writing restart files nrestart_skip times. By default (nrestart_skip=0), the restart files will be written every time the horizontally mean statistics file is updated (see nstat parameter); however, it may be inefficient (slow) if the statistics file (written to OUT_STAT directory) is written often and the domain is large. Therefore, this parameters allows one to skip writing the restart files. For example, nrestart_skip=11 will write the restart every 12th time the statistics file is written. At the end of the run, the restart will be always written regardless of the value of this parameter.
